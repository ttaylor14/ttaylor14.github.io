                        As an educator, for the past 11 years, I have been blessed to work with a team focused on working together to help prepare future 
                        innovators and leaders. Being a Visual Art Instructor, I have the distinct privilege of pushing student’s creativity, making 
                        connections to the world around them, and helping them to visually articulate their thoughts and feelings. My classroom is fast paced, 
                        constantly changing, and goal oriented.

                        I completed my Master of Science Degree in Software Engineering with a concentration in Data Science from Lipscomb University in 
                        December 2019. Through my studies I gained experience in SQL, Python, and R which I have utilized for data collection and visualization. 
                        I have begun work on a project to analyze and visualize student standard proficiency to help identify student 
                        deficiencies that can be addressed.

                        I completed a concentration in Data Science as part of my Software Engineering degree. I have experience utilizing Python and R for data manipulation 
                        and ggplot and Dash for data analysis and visualizations. I have also begun working with a teacher to use IXL student data to show students the 
                        correlation between IXL practice and benchmark exams.

                Through my years as a Robotics coach, advisor, and coordinator I directed, organized, and led professional development, tournaments, and community events. I handled 
                the fundraising and budgeting for the self-supporting school program. This included the marketing, organization, and communication with hundreds of Jr. Robotics Camp 
                participants and volunteers. I also helped prepare students, coaches, and parents for local and international competitions, judging rooms, and interviewing professionals.

                   I recently completed my Master of Science Degree in Software Engineering with a concentration in Data Science from Lipscomb University in December 2019. 
                   Through my studies I have gained experience in SQL, Python, and R, but I am eager to learn new tools, languages, and processes.
