                Project Overview:
            </b></p>
            <p>
                This project was intended to record and analyze student time in and out of my classroom. This data would help ide
                ntify trends in abuse of privileges, or identify students who spend an excess amount of time unnecessarily in other 
                teachers classrooms. This data can then be compared to student achievement to identify if there is a correlation between 
                bathroom breaks and student achievement.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an ongoing project that will be updated periodically as new information 
                is collected.
            </p>

            <p><b>
                Step 1: Data Input
            </b></p>

            <p>
                Data is collected and put into the computer by the teacher. This takes a matter of seconds and can be added 
                after the fact using a sign in and out sheet. Student names, class periods, and locations are already in lists. 
                This allows the teachers to quickly add student data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is a portion of the Google Form that was used for data collection:

                Step 2: Student Classes
            </b></p>

            <p>
                This data can be quickly added from a teacher's class roster. Once added the student names are accessible 
                in the drop down data collection tab. As data is provided it is automatically associated with these class tabs.
                This allows the teacher to quickly see and identify trends by student and class. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note all data was also adjusted to remove student and teacher specifics for this posting. All student 
                names are randomized student names.
                
            </p>

                Step 3: Data Visualization
            </b></p>

            <p>
                Once data was collected a visual dashboard was created in order to visualize the data for easier consumption.
                The goal of this dashboard was to quickly identify trends by class period, gender, and time of day. The ultimate 
                goal is to help limit student abuse of hallway passes and keep track of student data in case it is needed to 
                identify who was where and when.
                
            </p>

                Step 4: Future Additions
            </b></p>

            <p>
                I would like to create an entry form to create an easier to enter format that could be provided to students to complete 
                from their own personal devices. This would allow students to carry the work load off teh teacher and allow the teacher 
                to focus on providing students with the tools and information they need to master the subject matter.

            </p>

            <p>
                Another addition would be to connect multiple classrooms data collection. This would allow teachers to see the total 
                times in and out of class throughout the school day. This would help to eliminate students who attempt to utilize bathroom 
                passes in every class throughout the school day. This would also provide administration with the ability to see all students 
                currently out of the classroom at any given moment.
